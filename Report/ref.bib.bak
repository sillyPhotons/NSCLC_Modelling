  abstract        = {The tool most commonly used for quantitative predictions of dose/fractionation dependencies in radiotherapy is the mechanistically based linear-quadratic (LQ) model. The LQ formalism is now almost universally used for calculating radiotherapeutic isoeffect doses for different fractionation/protraction schemes. In summary, the LQ model has the following useful properties for predicting isoeffect doses: (1) it is a mechanistic, biologically based model; (2) it has sufficiently few parameters to be practical; (3) most other mechanistic models of cell killing predict the same fractionation dependencies as does the LQ model; (4) it has well-documented predictive properties for fractionation/dose-rate effects in the laboratory; and (5) it is reasonably well validated, experimentally and theoretically, up to about 10 Gy/fraction and would be reasonable for use up to about 18 Gy per fraction. To date, there is no evidence of problems when the LQ model has been applied in the clinic.},

  abstract    = {The next generation of AI applications will continuously interact with the environment and learn from these interactions. These applications impose new and demanding systems requirements, both in terms of performance and flexibility. In this paper, we consider these requirements and present Ray---a distributed system to address them. Ray implements a unified interface that can express both task-parallel and actor-based computations, supported by a single dynamic execution engine. To meet the performance requirements, Ray employs a distributed scheduler and a distributed and fault-tolerant store to manage the system's control state. In our experiments, we demonstrate scaling beyond 1.8 million tasks per second and better performance than existing specialized systems for several challenging reinforcement learning applications.},
